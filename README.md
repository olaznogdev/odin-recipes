Odin project's RECIPES!

This is my first project in this learning platform. Before i have done almost complete the first Certification in FreeCodecamp but, c'est la vie, i couldn't keep going. Life things, you know. Anyway, i'm really excited in what The Odin Project has to offer. I'm having so much fun so far and it's just starting. I can't wait to get my hands over CSS and JS again (that's what she said). I shouldn't keep going with the jokes, im suposed to work hard. Let's do it boy!
