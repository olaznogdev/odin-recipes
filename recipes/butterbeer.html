    <p>I figure this is probably one that everybody knows and has been curious about, so it makes an appropriate first post. I adapted this recipe with some minor changes from Sandra Lee of the Food Network. I normally can't stand the woman but I have to give her kudos to for this one... I came across approximately 42 billion different recipes for Butterbeer but I liked this one best. Perfect for the holidays!</p>
