    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>For the crust:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/4 cups All-Purpose Flour</li>
        <li>1/2 cup Butter</li>
        <li>1/4 cup Ice Water</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp Salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the filling:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups Whole Milk</li>
        <li>1/2 cup Cream</li>
        <li>2/3 cup Light Brown Sugar</li>
        <li>2 Egg Yolks, whisked</li>
        <li>4 tbs. Corn Starch</li>
        <li>1 tbs. Unsalted Butter</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp. Cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp Salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the topping:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup Heavy Whipping Cream</li>
        <li>2 tbs Granulated Sugar</li>
        <li>Cinnamon (for sprinkling)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 F. In a mixing bowl, combine flour and salt. Cut in butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.</li>
        <li>Stir in the iced water a little bit at a time, until the dough comes together and you are able to form a ball. Wrap the ball of dough in plastic wrap and chill for at least 4 hours.</li>
        <li>Using a pastry roller, roll out the dough to fit a 9-inch pie tine and press the dough evenly into the bottom and sides of the tin. Cut off excess.</li>
        <li>Bake the crust by itself at 375 degrees F for 7 minutes. Remove from oven and set aside.</li>
        <li>Time to start on the filling. In a double boiler, combine the milk, cream, brown sugar, cornstarch, salt and cinnamon. Stir the mixture using a whisk and keep stirring until the mixture thickens. If you don't have double boiler, use this method for a makeshift one.</li>
        <li>Whisk in the egg yolks, pouring them in slowly. Continue to whisk constantly until the mixture thickens to almost the consistency of pudding.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat, then add the butter and vanilla and stir some more, until both are completely incorporated.</li>
        <li>Pour the mixture into the pie crust.</li>
        <li>Bake pie at 375 F for another 7 minutes, then remove from oven.</li>
        <li>Let the pie cool in the fridge until it's at least room temperature. When it's almost done cooling, prepare the whipped cream: Add the cream and sugar into a mixing bowl and whip with hand mixer until you are able to form peaks. Be careful not to over-whip.</li>
        <li>Spread whipped cream on top of the chilled pie and finish with sprinkled cinnamon.</li>
    </ol>
